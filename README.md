# Portfolio-Repository

- README includes a brief (1-3 sentence) description of all files included in the repository.

Each fileâ€™s explanation should include:
A) name of file
B) what the file does
C) why you created the file (i.e., for an assignment? Fun? Work?)



- Final draft of your function tutorial is included in the portfolio repository (and properly explained by the README of that repository)
